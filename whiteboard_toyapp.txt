if an index needs to be updated by a call to the database anyway,
can is it best to update entire page, or write it so that a call will it update database, but also
use input to dynamically change webpage at the same time, seems dicey, as you would want confirmation that
the db had been updated, if the list is pulling from database, that would serve as confirmation?

-/new_event should be a post
post "/new event"
input = params
db connexec(insert $1 )input

redirect "tracked"

not null violation?

make each list item a link to its own page,
with a button to log
-event erb
-event erb layout will show event as h1

individual page,
-make button,
-pushing button timestamps,
  -first check bind with alert
  -then use jquery timestamp as input for post?

questions, timestamp,
deletions from post request,
server location important, must work out issues with time/zone conflicts,
maybe walk through doing a psql function, so if new info is entered in one column, another auto fills
linking tables, also good,


use constraints rather than deletions,
reuatest sql, start, set to now,
select
created at
datetime.new
normalizing db


3/8,
starting over,
make tables:
events,
id, event name (eventually add user_id created by column)
times,
event_id, references events.id, time/date stamp

3/14, id is used as reference for pages, still need to change the searches by id as well,
whiteboard
1. users,
- need sessions,
- new user /post, include user id and password
    -first make log in page
    -add to db
      -new table for users
        -id primary key,
        -associate user id in
        -look at corning for schema
        -when displaying events, choice for all events or user events
        search events or by user id
        -on login, if user does not exist, offer to creat a new one, with hide show button
        -ability to delete user info, clear table?, make a couple of levels of barriers,
        -ability to delete instances
        -ability to delete events

- new user /post should add row to users table in toyapp db
- cookies should be assinged to users based on sign in
- change searching db by id, current searched by name in some places,
- consider making a user class, so that when a user logs in a user object is made that passed the use
ful information, is there anything there that would be needed that was not passed in cookies?

3/16,
-fix new event to include user_id tag for future reference
